# Budgeting-App-JavaScript

Budgeting app made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS only.

The app shows the balance, income and outcome. It also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), with ability to toggle between the income list (that shows only all income entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and an all list that shows all the entries.

The user can edit or delete an entry.

The app also has a chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.

The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, or reboot his machine, he can always find  his data there.
